% \section{Organization}
% \label{sec:intro:organisation}

% This thesis is divided into three parts. 
% The rest of this document is organized as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Part~\ref{part:background} introduces the common background of our work,
%   formulate the problem, presents the existing solutions and discusses the use-case
%   requirements, this part is divided into three chapters:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Chapter~\ref{ch:my-domain} provides a complete and up-to-date 
%     review of the MyDomain.
%     \item Chapter~\ref{ch:requirements} presents a use-case point of view of the
%     ...

%     been designed in the state of the art of ...
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Part~\ref{part:contributions}, in light of what we saw in the existing work, 
%   we will here justify some protocol choices used in our approach...
%   \item Part~\ref{part:evaluation} provides an experimental evaluation 
%   demonstrating the benefits of our approach, compared to other solutions 
%   from the state of the art.
