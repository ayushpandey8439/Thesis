	abstract = {The Cypher property graph query language is an evolving language, originally designed and implemented as part of the Neo4j graph database, and it is currently used by several commercial database products and researchers. We describe Cypher 9, which is the first version of the language governed by the openCypher Implementers Group. We first introduce the language by example, and describe its uses in industry. We then provide a formal semantic definition of the core read-query features of Cypher, including its variant of the property graph data model, and its ASCII Art graph pattern matching mechanism for expressing subgraphs of interest to an application. We compare the features of Cypher to other property graph query languages, and describe extensions, at an advanced stage of development, which will form part of Cypher 10, turning the language into a compositional language which supports graph projections and multiple named graphs.},

	abstract = {Given continually increasing core counts, multiprocessor software scaling is critical. One set of applications that is especially difficult to parallelize efficiently are those that operate on hierarchical data. In such applications, correct execution relies on all threads coordinating their accesses within the hierarchy. At the same time, high-performance execution requires that this coordination be efficient and that it maximize parallelism. In this paper, we identify two key scalability bottlenecks in the coordination of hierarchical parallelism by studying the hierarchical data partitioning framework within the NetApp® WAFL® file system. We first observe that the global synchronization required to enforce the hierarchical constraints limits performance on increased core counts. We thus propose a distributed architecture, called Scheduler Pools, that divides the hierarchy into disjoint subhierarchies that can be managed independently in the common case, thereby reducing coordination overhead. We next observe that periodically draining all in-flight operations in order to facilitate the execution of coarse-grained operations in the hierarchy results in an excess of idle CPU cycles. To address this issue, we propose a new scheme, called Hierarchy-Aware Draining, that minimizes wasted CPU cycles by draining only those regions of the hierarchy that are required to execute the desired operation. When implemented together in the context of WAFL, Scheduler Pools and Hierarchy-Aware Draining overcome the observed scalability bottlenecks. Our evaluation with a range of benchmarks on high-end storage systems shows throughput gains of up to 33\% and reductions in latency of up to 64\%.},

	abstract = {Atomic sections are a recent and popular idiom to support the development of concurrent programs. Updates performed within an atomic section should not be visible to other threads until the atomic section has been executed entirely. Traditionally, atomic sections are supported through the use of optimistic concurrency, either using a transactional memory hardware, or an equivalent software emulation (STM).This paper explores automatically supporting atomic sections using pessimistic concurrency. We present a system that combines compiler and runtime techniques to automatically transform programs written with atomic sections into programs that only use locking primitives. To minimize contention in the transformed programs, our compiler chooses from several lock granularities, using fine-grain locks whenever it is possible.This paper formally presents our framework, shows that our compiler is sound (i.e., it protects all shared locations accessed within atomic sections), and reports experimental results.},

	abstract = {Modern block-addressable NVMe SSDs provide much higher bandwidth and similar performance for random and sequential access. Persistent key-value stores (KVs) designed for earlier storage devices, using either Log-Structured Merge (LSM) or B trees, do not take full advantage of these new devices. Logic to avoid random accesses, expensive operations for keeping data sorted on disk, and synchronization bottlenecks make these KVs CPU-bound on NVMe SSDs.We present a new persistent KV design. Unlike earlier designs, no attempt is made at sequential access, and data is not sorted when stored on disk. A shared-nothing philosophy is adopted to avoid synchronization overhead. Together with batching of device accesses, these design decisions make for read and write performance close to device bandwidth. Finally, maintaining an inexpensive partial sort in memory produces adequate scan performance.We implement this design in KVell, the first persistent KV able to utilize modern NVMe SSDs at maximum bandwidth. We compare KVell against available state-of-the-art LSM and B tree KVs, both with synthetic benchmarks and production workloads. KVell achieves throughput at least 2x that of its closest competitor on read-dominated workloads, and 5x on write-dominated workloads. For workloads that contain mostly scans, KVell performs comparably or better than its competitors. KVell provides maximum latencies an order of magnitude lower than the best of its competitors, even on scan-based workloads.},

abstract = {To adapt database technology to new environments like cloud platforms or multi-core hardware, or to try anew to provide an extensible database platform, it is useful to separate transaction services from data management elements that need close physical proximity to data. With "generic" transactional services of concurrency control and recovery in a separate transactional component (TC), indexing, cache and disk management, now in a data component (DC), can be simplified and tailored more easily to the platform or to a data type extension with a special purpose index. This decomposition requires that details of the DC's management of data be hidden from the TC. Thus, locking and logging need to be "logical", which poses a number of problems. One problem is the handling of locking for ranges of keys. Locks need to be taken at the TC prior to the records and their keys being known to the TC. We describe generic two approaches for dealing with this. (1) Make a "speculative" visit" to the DC to learn key values. (2) Lock a "covering resource" first, then learn and lock key values and ultimately release the covering resource lock. The "table" is the only logical (and hence known to the TC) covering resourse in the traditional locking hierarchy, but using it limits concurrency. Concurrency is improved with the introduction of new partition resources. We show how partitions as covering resources combine high concurrency with low locking overhead. Using partitions is sufficiently effective to consider adapting it for a traditional database kernel.},

This paper defines the concepts of transaction, consistency and schedule and shows that consistency requires that a transaction cannot request new locks after releasing a lock. Then it is argued that a transaction needs to lock a logical rather than a physical subset of the database. These subsets may be specified by predicates. An implementation of predicate locks which satisfies the consistency condition is suggested.},

	abstract = {Established benchmark suites for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), such as DaCapo, ScalaBench, and SPECjvm2008, lack workloads that take advantage of the parallel programming abstractions and concurrency primitives offered by the JVM and the Java Class Library. However, such workloads are fundamental for understanding the way in which modern applications and data-processing frameworks use the JVM's concurrency features, and for validating new just-in-time (JIT) compiler optimizations that enable more efficient execution of such workloads. We present Renaissance, a new benchmark suite composed of modern, real-world, concurrent, and object-oriented workloads that exercise various concurrency primitives of the JVM. We show that the use of concurrency primitives in these workloads reveals optimization opportunities that were not visible with the existing workloads. We use Renaissance to compare performance of two state-of-the-art, production-quality JIT compilers (HotSpot C2 and Graal), and show that the performance differences are more significant than on existing suites such as DaCapo and SPECjvm2008. We also use Renaissance to expose four new compiler optimizations, and we analyze the behavior of several existing ones.

	abstract = {This article presents Pot, a system that leverages the concept of preordered transactions to achieve deterministic multithreaded execution of programs that use Transactional Memory. Preordered transactions eliminate the root cause of nondeterminism in transactional execution: they provide the illusion of executing in a deterministic serial order, unlike traditional transactions that appear to execute in a nondeterministic order that can change from execution to execution. Pot uses a new concurrency control protocol that exploits the serialization order to distinguish between fast and speculative transaction execution modes in order to mitigate the overhead of imposing a deterministic order. We build two Pot prototypes: one using STM and another using off-the-shelf HTM. To the best of our knowledge, Pot enables deterministic execution of programs using off-the-shelf HTM for the first time. An experimental evaluation shows that Pot achieves deterministic execution of TM programs with low overhead, sometimes even outperforming nondeterministic executions, and clearly outperforming the state of the art.},

The key insight of this work is that we do not need to use the same costly barriers for all the memory managed by a real-sized application, if only a small fraction of the memory is under contention—lightweight barriers may be used in this case. In this work, we propose a new solution based on an approach of adaptive object metadata (AOM) to promote the use of a fast path to access objects that are not under contention. We show that this approach is able to make the performance of an STM competitive with the best fine-grained lock-based approaches in some of the more challenging benchmarks.},

The requests range from web services to gaming for computation intensive applications. In order to process these requests, the data centers exploit in-memory data for high performance and ensure transactional properties for concurrent requests such as atomicity, consistency, and isolation. Traditionally lock-based synchronization has been used for the consistency of data, but is inherently error-prone. For example, coarse-grained locking, in which a large data structure is protected using a single lock is simple and easy to use, but permits little concurrency. In contrast, with fine-grained locking, in which each component of a data structure (e.g., a hash table bucket) is protected by a lock, programmers must acquire only necessary and sufficient locks to obtain maximum concurrency without compromising safety, and must avoid deadlocks when acquiring multiple locks. Both these situations are highly prone to programmer errors.},

  abstract="Locking continues to be a primary technique used to achieve thread synchronization. Especially in the case of rooted hierarchies, semantic locking can be achieved with physical locks at various granularity levels. Such a multi-granularity locking (MGL) provides interesting trade-off between the locking cost and the size of the locked sub-hierarchy. At one extreme, fine-grained locking precisely locks the nodes of interest, but incurs a high locking cost. In contrast, a coarse-grained lock may lock the root of the hierarchy minimizing the locking cost, but locking many more nodes than required. Existing approaches to MGL (i) do not work well with non-tree hierarchies such as DAGs, (ii) disallow structural updates to the hierarchy, (iii) do not support the co-existence of fine-grained and coarse-grained locks, or (iv) are rigid towards their underlying memory usage. In this work, we propose a versatile technique named FlexiGran, which does not have any of these issues. It allows co-existence of hierarchical and fine-grained locks in an arbitrarily shaped hierarchy which can undergo structural alterations at run time, while allowing a user to control its memory usage by adding optional approximations. We illustrate the effectiveness of FlexiGran using STMBench7, and compare it empirically with two recent locking techniques, DomLock and HiFi. On a static hierarchy with more than 1 million nodes, FlexiGran shows an improvement in throughput of around 159{\%} and 374{\%} on an average, compared to HiFi and DomLock respectively.",

Akka Concurrency will show you what it means to design and write software in the paradigm of Akka. You'll learn how to think about your software in new and exciting ways that will allow you to express your designs naturally, allowing you to focus on the business of your software more than on the concurrency of it. This book picks up where the Akka documentation leaves off, exploring the how and the why of Akka, in a way that will empower you to grow your applications to new levels of scalability, responsiveness, and performance.}

abstract = {Cloud computing is a new computing paradigm, combining diverse client devices -- PCs, smartphones, sensors, single-function, and embedded -- with computation and data storage in the cloud. As with every advance in computing, programming is a fundamental challenge, as the cloud is a concurrent, distributed system running on unreliable hardware and networks.Orleans is a software framework for building reliable, scalable, and elastic cloud applications. Its programming model encourages the use of simple concurrency patterns that are easy to understand and employ correctly. It is based on distributed actor-like components called grains, which are isolated units of state and computation that communicate through asynchronous messages. Within a grain, promises are the mechanism for managing both asynchronous messages and local task-based concurrency. Isolated state and a constrained execution model allow Orleans to persist, migrate, replicate, and reconcile grain state. In addition, Orleans provides lightweight transactions that support a consistent view of state and provide a foundation for automatic error handling and failure recovery.We implemented several applications in Orleans, varying from a messaging-intensive social networking application to a data- and compute-intensive linear algebra computation. The programming model is a general one, as Orleans allows the communications to evolve dynamically at runtime. Orleans enables a developer to concentrate on application logic, while the Orleans runtime provides scalability, availability, and reliability.},
