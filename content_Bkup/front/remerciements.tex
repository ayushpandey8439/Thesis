A PhD is a long journey. For me, it took 3 years, 3 supervisors and education in 3 countries to finally reach here. Throughout this time, I have been supported by many people, without whom I would not have been able to reach here. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them. 

First and foremost, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of this thesis, \todo{Add names of rapporteurs}. I am grateful for their time and effort in reviewing my work and providing valuable feedback. I would also like to thank the members of the jury, \todo{Add names of jury members} for taking the time to read, evaluate and provide feedback on this body of work. The members of my CSD committee, Bernd Amann and Ahmed Bouajjani have been a great source of support and guidance throughout my PhD. I am grateful for their time and effort in helping me navigate the challenges of a PhD and correcting the direction of my research. 

The people without whom this thesis would not have been possible are my supervisors, Marc Shapiro, Julien Sopena and Swan Dubois. From asking me if i would like to do a PhD back in 2021 while i was in Germany to the day I defended my thesis, I cannot thank Marc enough for his constant support, guidance and well placed reality checks. Julien, you have been a great inspiration, not only in the rigor of research but also in correcting my French which, even after several corrections, is still awful. Swan, you have been a great mentor and helped me navigate the finer details of theoretical computer science. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with you all.

To the seniors in the lab with whom i have shared numerous lunches, coffee breaks and discussions, thank you for making my time in the lab enjoyable. Thank you Pierre, Jonathan and Alessio for taking care of DELYS and your help in my research. 

I have had the pleasure of working with some amazing people during my time in the lab. Saalik, Benoît and Laurent have been great friends and colleagues, helping me navigate the French bureaucracy, teaching me bits of french culture and also helping me with my research direction. I am grateful for your friendship and support. To my fellow PhDs, Étienne, Aymeric, Célia, Baptiste and Daniel; Thank you for your discussions and support. I wish you well for your future. 

To the lehrstuhl softwaretechnik of RPTU, i extend my thanks, for introducing me to the wonderful world of parallel and distributed systems. I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked with Prof. Dr. Annette Bieniusa without whom I would not have been able to start my PhD.

Finally, the people without whom this thesis would not have been imaginable. My family, who dealt with years of daily phone and video calls, the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertainty of being abroad and the stresses of a PhD, i am eternally grateful for your support. I dedicate this thesis to you Papa, Mummy and Yash. To my friends from Germany, India and France, thank you for your support, your love and your friendship.

Thankyou everyone.
